<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
