Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months.
