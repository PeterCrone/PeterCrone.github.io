<p>The operation of this switch is designed so that movement of the forklift is not possible while the operator is stocking or picking product.

<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights.
