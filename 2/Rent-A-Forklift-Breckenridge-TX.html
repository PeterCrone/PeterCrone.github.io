Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load. Another major reason why accidents occur is due to improper loading and unloading of the forklift.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Renting Forklifts in and Other Material Handling Equipment Breckenridge </h2>
<p>Our renowned build quality, coupled with safety innovations such as the ‘Presence Detection System' (PDS and PDS+), gives our counterbalance forklift trucks a competitive edge; helping you to improve your operational efficiency.

<p>Maintain forklifts in safe condition free of defective or missing parts through daily visual checks and regular preventive maintenance.

<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>

As one of New England's top forklift distributors, NITCO maintains a huge new and used inventory of all the forklift types listed above.</p>
<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle. Additionally, the report enlists several leading companies that have generated substantial Forklift Trucks Market revenue in recent years and forecasts the companies that are likely to emerge leading in the coming years.</p>
