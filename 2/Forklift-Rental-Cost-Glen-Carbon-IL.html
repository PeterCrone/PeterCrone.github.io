<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.

The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
