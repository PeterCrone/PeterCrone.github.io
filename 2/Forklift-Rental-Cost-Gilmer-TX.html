The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine.
