Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>As many models in our fleet feature four wheel drive, these machines are ideal to work outside carrying out heavy duty operations. Today many business owners are meeting the tasks of material movement with the help of these hand pallet trucks. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

Since there is a wide selection of styles and models, it can be difficult to select a forklift.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>If you do not have recharging stations in your facility, Class IV forklifts are the next best alternatives.

If you are renting an electric truck, and do not have the time to idle the truck for charging request a second battery.</p>

<p>RT forklift manufacturers—and there are more than you might think, some with surprisingly broad product lines—are pursuing ongoing refinement of their machines. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
