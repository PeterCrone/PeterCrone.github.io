<h2>Maintenance of Forklift Brakes Prevents Smashups in Dousman </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Maintain forklifts in safe condition free of defective or missing parts through daily visual checks and regular preventive maintenance.

Many of our long-term customers had their first exposure to the fuel efficiency, high productivity and ease of operation of Linde forklifts through their dealings with our forklift hire department. They are also ideal machines for loading trucks, as only the forks stick out in front.</p>

These forklifts are also known as straight mast forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>

Construction, heavy industry and mining continue to take advantage of rough- and all-terrain forklifts, while construction and agriculture have discovered the versatility of telehandlers.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
