This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. The boom can reach out directly in front of the forklift, and it can be extended to raise directly above it. Variable reach rough terrain forklifts were originally built for residential and commercial masonry trades.

<p>A suspension lift kit will truly give you that monster truck feeling, as they can be raised as high as practically possible.

Most rough-terrain forklift models have gasoline- or diesel-powered engines, but some models run on propane. Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast.</p>
