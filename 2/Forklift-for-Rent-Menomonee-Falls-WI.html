<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
