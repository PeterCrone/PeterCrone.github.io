<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. The forklift's AC system features precise speed control, quickly adapts to varying conditions, and varies output for continued, consistent operation. This is a person we would never invite to a party; a person whose lifted truck parked outside a restaurant we were considering would cause us to eat somewhere else. There are many good advantages of hiring material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Forklift Rentals - Our fully stocked rental department can deliver equipment next day for short or long term rentals.
