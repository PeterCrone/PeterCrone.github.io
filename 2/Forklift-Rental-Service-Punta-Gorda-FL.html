<p>Depends on the pallet jack type and capacity. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile. By visiting your facility, our equipment specialists gain first-hand knowledge of your production, the product you move and challenges experienced by your forklift operators. One type of counterbalance forklift is the three-wheel model which provides better control when driving the truck.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control. These tools and techniques should make cleaning any lifted truck easier, but finding a good auto detailer may be the more economical option if you can afford it.</p>
