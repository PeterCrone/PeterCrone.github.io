<p>Bobcat: Bobcat is one of the world's most recognized name brands in heavy equipment and it's easy to see why: they provide a wide range of machinery with rough terrain capability. If the Hydraulic hand Pallet truck is not overloaded beyond the rated capacity and not pushed around on very rough surfaces then it gives good service for a very long extended period of more than 5 years.</p>
