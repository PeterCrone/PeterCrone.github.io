<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment. In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres.

<p>While excellent for indoor use, reach trucks for not suitable for outdoor work due to their under-carriage clearance. Many rough terrain forklifts can also handle work platforms.
