Although not every PIT is a forklift, because PITs are commonly called forklifts,” this course manual generally uses the term forklift,” although at times the terms truck” and PIT” are also used. In addition, the demand for safe and efficient material handling equipment in various cross industry verticals has led to an increase in adoption of these since recent years.</p>

There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear.
