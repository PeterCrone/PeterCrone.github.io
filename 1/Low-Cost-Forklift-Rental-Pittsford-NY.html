<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in Pittsford </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator.
