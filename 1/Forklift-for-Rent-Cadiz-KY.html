<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts. Order Pickers : Use: Order picker trucks place the operator on an elevating platform along with the forks. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>

As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be.

<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
