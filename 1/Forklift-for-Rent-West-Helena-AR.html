On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>
