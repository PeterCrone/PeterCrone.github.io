Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>

If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
