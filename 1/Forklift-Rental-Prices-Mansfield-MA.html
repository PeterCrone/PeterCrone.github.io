Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training. Short Term forklift rental solutions can help you react immediately to a situation with a predicted cost. In a changing and fluctuating market, the rough-terrain forklift and telehandler sector is not without its challenges.</p>

The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
