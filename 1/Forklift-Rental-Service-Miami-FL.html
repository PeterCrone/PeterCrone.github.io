If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps. It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
