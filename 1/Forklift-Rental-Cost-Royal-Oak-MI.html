<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>

Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts might look like they can only tackle one type of job. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order.
