<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites. That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts the mast shall be vertical or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
