Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
