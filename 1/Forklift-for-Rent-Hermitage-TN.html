An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it.

<h3>Used Fork Lift Trucks In Stock Hermitage TN 37076</h3>
<p>Understand the causes of instability of the truck and loads. We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one. Overall, a sit-down forklift is the right call for operations that need several hours of forklift work a day, or need to put their operator's comfort, safety, and accessibility first.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
