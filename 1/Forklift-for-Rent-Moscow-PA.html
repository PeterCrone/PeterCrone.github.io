<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The PTH Series pallet jack is designed for smooth, and quiet operation and easy handling so operators experience less fatigue and work more efficiently. Commonly lifted vehicles include most pickups and large SUVs, especially the Ford Excursion Any vehicle designed for off-road use, however, can be lifted.

<h3>Forklift Training Program Moscow PA</h3>
<p>With nine models to suit specific heavy duty applications, the H25-32XM series of all terrain forklifts provides high productivity, reliability, fuel efficiency and outstanding driver comfort to deliver an excellent return on investment. Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on. Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast.
