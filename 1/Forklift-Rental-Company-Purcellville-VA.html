<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least. Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
