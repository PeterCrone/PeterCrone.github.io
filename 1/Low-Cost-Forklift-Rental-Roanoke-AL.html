Likewise, in current scenarios, the diesel forklift trucks are estimated to have an exponential growth rate over the forecast period ranging from the most simple to the advance manufactured Forklift Trucks that includes electronically controlled engines and GPS communication systems.</p>
<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>
