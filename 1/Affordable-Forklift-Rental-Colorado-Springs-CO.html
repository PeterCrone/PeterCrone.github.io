A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
