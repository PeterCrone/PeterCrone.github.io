<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Our Electric hand pallet truck is very simple to handle and remarkably maneuverable and safe in every way. Nissan was the No. 1 forklift retailer in the world last year, earning $8.562 billion through their materials handling division. Discover our wide range of Jungheinrich forklifts and reach trucks - designed specifically for your application. Yale® trucks are manufactured in an ISO 9001:2008 registered facility and range in capacity from 2,000 to 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
